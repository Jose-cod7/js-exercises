// The code is valid but is misleading and could be improved
// Refactor the code to make it better
// What was wrong with the original code? two things; the first was the sign of the comparision operator, must have 3 equal signs instread of two, the other one is the value of tue variable and theother is the value of the variable.
// Leave comments above your changes to explain
// I add a equal sign in the comparision operator.
